# M2D2

Ultra-high-throughput screening of antimicrobial combination therapies using a two-stage transparent machine learning model M2D2

Here, we present M2D2, a two-stage machine learning (ML) pipeline that identifies promising antimicrobial drug combinations, which are crucial for combating drug resistance. M2D2 addresses key challenges in drug combination discovery by predicting drug synergies using computationally generated drug-protein interaction data, thereby circumventing the need for expensive omics data.

Provides more extensive heatmaps for all computational and omics datasets. The datasets are protein - drug interactions calculated by ML and molecular docking, and a set of omics data taken from literature including chemogenomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics. The heatmaps are separated into drugs and pathways. The drugs folder contains individual heatmaps for the 16 drugs that overlap between the five datasets options provided. The pathways folder contains heatmaps for classes of pathways for all drugs and all datasets.
